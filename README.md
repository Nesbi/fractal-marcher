A simple 3D engine in JavaScript for displaying 3D fractals.

Still buggy and does currently only support spheres.
Other object types, reflections and shadows are on my agenda.


FAQ
---
### Where did your inspiration came from?
Simple: [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk)
Nice video, nice channel.

### Why in pure JavaScript?
Dunno. Fun? 

But in all seriousness it's about the challenge to get something so resource entensive running despite the hardware and language limitations.

### Is the engine fast?
Hell no. 3-4 fps at 400x400px.

(Does have low level rendering for movement)

A special focus does lay on making it usable despite those limitations.
