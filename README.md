Fractal Marcher
===============
A simple 3D engine in JavaScript for displaying 3D fractals.

Still buggy and does currently only support spheres.
Other object types, reflections and shadows are on my agenda.


FAQ
---
### Where did your inspiration came from?
Simple: [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk)
Nice video, nice channel.

### Why in JavaScript?
Dunno. Fun?

### Is the engine fast?
Hell no. 3-4 fps at 400x400px.

The fractals are not the reason the frame rate tanks so bad. (JS isâ€¦)

But I do want to enhance the performance in the future. 
Maybe by outsourcing the resource heavy load to wasm.

Or I'll ignore the realtime speed and only use it to render gifs.
